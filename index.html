            Anima is a Danish animal welfare association, which was founded in 2000. We work to ensure that animals are respected, not abused. This applies whether it is about pets, farm animals, fur animals, experimental animals or animals in entertainment.</p>  <img class="downArrow jump" src="images/down_arrow.svg" alt="downarrow"></section>

        <h1>Concept Description</h1>
        <p>We want to make people aware of the way that fish is treated. There are a lot of campaigns about chickens, cows, pigs, etc. and people really started to notice the facts, but with all of these, there is still a very large amount of people that consume fish thinking that it is healthier than the others just because they don’t know the way they are spending their live ( in captivity).</p><br>
        <p>
            As a few people may know, there are some negative things happening also in this area. For example: the color of the salmon is not actually the real one for a captive fish, it is obtained artificially or the simple fact that there are some fishes escaping and risking to pass lice or diseases to the healthy wild fish in the sea.
            So we would like to show that this is also happening, this should also be concerning and we want to do something about it.

        <h1>Some dummy text</h1>
        <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.</p><br>


         <p> It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p><br>
