            Anima is a Danish animal welfare association, which was founded in 2000. We work to ensure that animals are respected, not abused. This applies whether it is about pets, farm animals, fur animals, experimental animals or animals in entertainment.</p></section>

        <h1>Concept Description</h1>
        <p>We want to make people aware of the way that fish is treated. There are a lot of campaigns about chickens, cows, pigs, etc. and people really started to notice the facts, but with all of these, there is still a very large amount of people that consume fish thinking that it is healthier than the others just because they don’t know the way they are spending their live ( in captivity).</p>
        <p>
            As a few people may know, there are some negative things happening also in this area. For example: the color of the salmon is not actually the real one for a captive fish, it is obtained artificially or the simple fact that there are some fishes escaping and risking to pass lice or diseases to the healthy wild fish in the sea.
            So we would like to show that this is also happening, this should also be concerning and we want to do something about it.

        <p>Instagram is huge these days and so is the idea of Animal Welfare! <b>USE IT</b></p>
        <p>Use it more and maybe more frequently trying to reach out the audience and grow the account. (post once- twice a day)
            Fx. using hashtags, using instagram stories as well as Instagram TV. Maybe have a live educational show once a week/month.</p>
        <p>Most Millenials use Instagram on regular basis, and Animal Welfare is a huge concept these days. ANIMA is standing on a golden pedestal to reach out to them. They just need to know how to do it!</p>
